# Superstore-Time-Series-Analysis-Forecasting

#### Note: Plotly graphs don't seem to appear on github, will fix it soon!

## Overview
This project involves conducting time series analysis on sales data from a superstore. The goal is to analyze historical sales patterns, identify trends, seasonality, and other factors influencing sales performance, and develop predictive models to forecast future sales.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project comprises historical sales data from the superstore. It includes information such as sales revenue, quantity sold, product categories, customer segments, and timestamps for each transaction. The dataset spans multiple years, allowing for comprehensive analysis and modeling.

## Methodology
### Data Preprocessing
- Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the data.
- Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features such as day of the week, month, year, seasonality indicators, and lag variables.
- Data Transformation: Normalize or scale the data as needed for modeling.
  
### Time Series Analysis
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize the time series data to identify patterns, trends, and seasonality. Explore correlations between sales and other variables.
- Model Selection: Choose appropriate time series forecasting models, such as ARIMA, SARIMA.
- Model Training: Split the dataset into training and validation sets, and train the selected models on the training data.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the models using appropriate metrics.
  
## Results
The time series analysis reveals valuable insights into sales patterns and trends within the superstore dataset. The developed predictive models demonstrate reasonable accuracy in forecasting future sales, providing valuable guidance for inventory management, resource allocation, and strategic decision-making.

### Future Enhancements
- Dynamic Pricing Strategies: Explore dynamic pricing strategies based on demand forecasting and customer segmentation to optimize revenue and profitability.
